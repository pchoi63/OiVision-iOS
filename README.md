## About
Oi Vision is an iOS 16 application equipped with advanced OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, Apple Vision, to recognize text in images.
Reading small or poorly formatted text, such as physical mail, can be a significant obstacle for many individuals. 
Oi Vision was created by Oi Creation to address this issue directly. 
With the power of OCR technology, our app enables users to effortlessly convert text from images into accessible formats, making tasks like reading physical mail more convenient.
